# Hobbies

I like to read psychological books in my free time, and often find myself conseilling my close friends and family. I also read more about math to satisfy my long-held admiration of the French for their unique approach to mathematics.

My favourite airplane is the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

I am a fan of the Manchester City F.C. and have a decent collection of Japanese stationery, particularly mechanical pencils. My daily driver is the [Uni-ball Kuru Toga Alpha Gel](https://www.mpuni.co.jp/products/mechanical_pencils/sharp_pen/uni_a-gel/uni_agel.html).
